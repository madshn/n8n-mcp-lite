# n8n-mcp-lite

**MCP redesigned for real-world workflow scale.**

> If your n8n workflow has more than ~40 nodes, standard MCP becomes structurally unusable.
> n8n-mcp-lite remains viable.

## Benchmark

Measured on identical workflows. Token counts via the OpenAI tokenizer.

| Scenario | Standard MCP | n8n-mcp-lite | Reduction |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5-node workflow | ~4,000 tokens | ~500 tokens | **87%** |
| 78-node workflow | ~600,000+ tokens | ~16,500 tokens | **97%** |
| Focus on 2 nodes (from 38) | ~135,000 tokens | ~2,600 tokens | **98%** |

Above ~50 nodes, standard MCP stops being context-viable. n8n-mcp-lite remains usable.

Standard MCP implementations serialize the full workflow graph on every context turn. In large workflows, this produces token counts that exceed practical context windows entirely — making reliable AI assistance structurally impossible above a certain workflow size.

n8n-mcp-lite addresses this at the architecture level, not through compression or summarization hacks.

---

## Who This Is For

**n8n users with growing workflows**
- Want AI to help manage, debug, and extend workflows safely
- Don't want to understand n8n JSON internals
- Need confidence that AI won't break production

**Developers building production automation**
- Care about deterministic serialization
- Need selective context for large workflows
- Want rollback and structural guarantees before any mutation
- Build workflows with 30, 50, 100+ nodes

---

## Quick Start

1. Complete installation for your client ([Cursor](#cursor) / [Claude Desktop](#claude-desktop)).
2. Ask your AI assistant: *"List my n8n workflows."*
3. Ask: *"Scan workflow [name]."* — returns a lightweight overview without loading full JSON.
4. Ask: *"Focus on [node name]."* — loads only the nodes you need.
5. Make changes. Every mutation runs security checks and creates an auto-snapshot before touching n8n.

No n8n internals knowledge required. The server handles format translation, validation, and context management automatically.

---

## 5-Minute Validation Test

After installation:

1. Ask: *"List my workflows."*
2. Pick a workflow with 30+ nodes. Ask: *"Scan it."*
3. Note the token estimate in the response.
4. Compare it to the raw JSON size of that workflow.
5. Ask: *"Focus on [one node name]."* — see how much context drops further.

If you have a workflow above 50 nodes, the difference will be immediately visible.

## Real-World Scenarios

**Large workflows (50+ nodes)**

Standard MCP sends the entire workflow graph on every turn. At scale, this exceeds context windows entirely — responses degrade or fail. n8n-mcp-lite sends only what's needed, keeping interaction viable regardless of workflow size.

**Debugging broken expressions**

Ghost Payload attaches an `inputHint` to each focused node showing the exact `$json` field names arriving from upstream — pulled from real execution data. No more guessing what fields exist.

**Safe AI refactoring**

Every mutation runs a 7-layer security preflight before touching the n8n API. Hardcoded credentials, broken expressions, SQL injection patterns, and structural errors are caught and blocked. The API is never called on a failing check.

**Recovering from a bad change**

Every mutation auto-snapshots the workflow before executing. `rollback_workflow` restores any prior state exactly. Up to 20 snapshots per workflow, automatically pruned.

---

## What This Is

n8n-mcp-lite is an MCP server that connects AI clients (Claude, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible client) to an n8n instance. It exposes **26 tools** across six categories — reading, writing, activation, execution, versioning, and a node knowledge base — all operating on a compact serialization format purpose-built for AI interaction.

The server is designed to be:

- **Token-disciplined** — minimal context at every tool boundary
- **Architecturally safe** — every write operation runs security preflight and creates an auto-snapshot
- **Deterministic** — LiteNode format is stable and predictable across calls
- **Model-agnostic** — works with any MCP-compatible AI client

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 18.0.0
- An n8n instance with API access enabled
- An n8n API key (`Settings → API → Create API Key`)

Clone the repository and build:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LunkiBR/n8n-mcp-lite.git
cd n8n-mcp-lite
npm install
npm run build
```

---

### Cursor

Create or edit `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (global) or `.cursor/mcp.json` (per-project):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "n8n-mcp-lite": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/n8n-mcp-lite/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "N8N_HOST": "https://your-n8n.example.com",
        "N8N_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Cursor after saving. The MCP server will appear in the active tools panel.

---

### Claude Desktop

Edit the Claude Desktop configuration file:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "n8n-mcp-lite": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/n8n-mcp-lite/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "N8N_HOST": "https://your-n8n.example.com",
        "N8N_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop. The server registers automatically on startup.

> **Note**: Do not use relative paths in `args`. Claude Desktop sets the working directory to the system root on some platforms. Always use absolute paths.

---

### Generic MCP Clients

Any client that supports the Model Context Protocol stdio transport:

```json
{
  "command": "node",
  "args": ["/absolute/path/to/n8n-mcp-lite/dist/index.js"],
  "env": {
    "N8N_HOST": "https://your-n8n.example.com",
    "N8N_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
  }
}
```

The server communicates over `stdin`/`stdout` using the standard MCP protocol. No HTTP server is started.

---

### HTTP Streamable Transport (Remote / Cloud)

For remote or cloud MCP clients that cannot spawn a local subprocess, n8n-mcp-lite supports HTTP Streamable transport via `MCP_MODE=http`.

**Start the server in HTTP mode:**

```bash
MCP_MODE=http AUTH_TOKEN=your-secret-token \
  N8N_HOST=https://your-n8n.example.com N8N_API_KEY=your-api-key \
  node dist/index.js
```

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|:---:|---|
| `MCP_MODE` | No | `stdio` (default) or `http` |
| `AUTH_TOKEN` | HTTP only | Bearer token for authenticating HTTP requests |
| `MCP_PORT` | No | HTTP listen port. Default: `3000` |
| `MCP_HOST` | No | Bind address. Default: `0.0.0.0` |

**Claude Code `.mcp.json` config:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "n8n-mcp-lite": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://your-server:3000/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer your-secret-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Endpoints:**
- `POST /mcp` — MCP JSON-RPC requests (initialize, tool calls)
- `GET /mcp` — SSE stream for server-initiated messages (requires `mcp-session-id` header)
- `DELETE /mcp` — Session cleanup
- `GET /health` — Health check (no auth required)

Stdio transport remains the default. Existing configurations are unaffected.

## Architecture

### Why This Exists

AI-assisted automation breaks at scale because of context inflation. Standard MCP was not designed for workflows that grow past a few dozen nodes. n8n-mcp-lite is a serialization layer designed for AI reasoning — not a wrapper around the n8n API.

### The Core Problem

Standard MCP implementations pass the raw n8n workflow JSON to the model context on every call. A 78-node workflow produces over 600,000 tokens of raw JSON — well beyond any practical context window, and containing mostly positional metadata, default values, and structural noise irrelevant to the task at hand.

This is not a tokenizer efficiency problem. It is a serialization design problem.

### The n8n-mcp-lite Approach

```
n8n API (raw JSON)
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  Simplify Layer │  Strip defaults, normalize types, compress connections
└────────┬────────┘
         │  LiteNode format
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  Graph Analysis │  Build adjacency graph, detect segments and branches
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  Focus Engine   │  Compute boundaries, classify upstream/downstream,
│                 │  reduce non-target nodes to one-line dormant summaries
└────────┬────────┘
         │  Focused context payload
         ▼
       Model
```

The result: the model receives exactly the nodes relevant to the current task, with full parameter detail for focused nodes and compact summaries for everything else.

### Subsystems

**Serialization Layer** (`src/transform/simplify.ts`)
Converts raw n8n JSON to LiteNode format. Strips all-default values, omits empty fields, normalizes node type prefixes (`n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest` → `httpRequest`), and compresses the connection graph. The format is stable across n8n versions.

**Graph Analysis** (`src/transform/graph.ts`)
Builds a directed adjacency graph from the serialized workflow. Detects independent branches, segments by router output index, identifies entry and exit points, and classifies node relationships for focus boundary computation.

**Focus Engine** (`src/transform/focus.ts`)
Given a set of target nodes, computes the boundary of the focus area, classifies every other node as upstream, downstream, or parallel, and reduces non-focused nodes to single-line dormant summaries. Supports node selection, branch selection, range selection, and iterative expansion via `expand_focus`.

**Ghost Payload** — when an `executionId` is provided to `focus_workflow`, the engine reads that execution's input data and attaches an `inputHint` to each focused node showing the exact `$json` field names arriving from upstream. Eliminates expression guessing in debugging workflows.

**Security Preflight** (`src/security/preflight.ts`)
Every mutating tool (`create_workflow`, `update_workflow`, `update_nodes`) runs a multi-layer validation pass before touching the n8n API:

| Layer | What It Catches |
|---|---|
| Expression syntax | Missing `=` prefix, mismatched brackets, bare `$json`, legacy `$node[]` |
| Hardcoded credentials | OpenAI keys, AWS keys, Slack tokens, DB connection strings |
| SQL injection | `DROP TABLE`, `UNION SELECT`, comment injections, `DELETE` without `WHERE` |
| Node configuration | Unknown node types, invalid resource/operation combinations |
| Structural integrity | References to non-existent nodes, orphaned nodes |
| Type validation | String where number expected, number where boolean expected (warnings) |
| Property location | Parameters placed at top level that belong inside `options` (warnings) |

If any error-level finding is detected, the mutation is blocked and the response contains a structured `errors` array with exact field locations and fix instructions. The n8n API is never called.

**Version Store** (`src/versioning/version-store.ts`)
Before every mutation, the current workflow state is serialized to a JSON snapshot in `.versioning/{workflowId}/`. Up to 20 snapshots are retained per workflow; oldest are pruned automatically. `rollback_workflow` restores any snapshot exactly.

**Approval Gate** (`src/approval/approval-store.ts`)
Optional team safety layer, enabled via `N8N_REQUIRE_APPROVAL=true`. When enabled, mutating tools return a `pending` response with an `approve_token` instead of executing immediately. The caller must re-submit with the token to proceed. All attempted mutations are recorded to an append-only audit log at `.versioning/audit.log`, regardless of approval mode status.

**Node Knowledge Base** (`src/knowledge/`)
Static embedded database of n8n node schemas, workflow pattern templates, webhook payload schemas, expression recipes, and documented node quirks. Queried via `get_node`, `search_patterns`, `get_payload_schema`, `search_expressions`, and `get_n8n_knowledge`.

## Design Principles

**Context is a resource. Waste is architectural failure.**
The model should receive the minimum context necessary to complete the task correctly. Sending more is not safer — it is noisier.

**Determinism is not optional.**
LiteNode format is predictable. The same workflow produces the same serialized output on every call. The model can reason about structure without compensating for variance.

**Safety before execution — without exception.**
No mutation reaches the n8n API without passing preflight. No preflight-passing mutation executes without a prior snapshot. Rollback is always available.

**The model is a client, not a collaborator in protocol design.**
The server makes no assumptions about which model is on the other side of the MCP boundary. The protocol and the format work identically across all compliant clients.

**Minimal surface, maximum capability.**
26 tools cover the complete workflow lifecycle — create, read, update, delete, activate, debug, rollback, and learn — without redundancy.
